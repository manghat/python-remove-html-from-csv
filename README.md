# Removes HTML tags from a column in a .csv file 

## About :
The python script runs 2 versions of cleaning and returns a file with 4 additional columns:

1. **Regex matching** with "<>" , "&;"(with 4 or 5 characters in between) anything in between will be removed and "\\*" will be replaced with a white space character. **Note: the special characters will simply be removed.** eg: \&nbsp; \&rpos; etc.
2. **BeautifulSoup** HTML to text conversion. This will remove HTML tags and convert special characters into their respective ASCII characters
3. 2 parity columns which will return the difference in the number of charcters between the newly generated columns and the original columns. (This is basically a flag that you can check if there has been too many characters replaced)

## How to use

You need to install these modules:
- pandas
- bs4
- lxml
example:
```python -m pip install bs4 lxml pandas ```


1. Place the file in the same directory as the csv file
2. open terminal at the file location *windows* : `ctrl`+ `r` then `cmd` then `cd <path to file>`
3. Type: `python remove_html.py` and hit enter
3. Follow the instructions
4. You are done.




## Future plans
1. Auto detect filetype
2. multicolumn support
